A Single Phase Half-Wave Controllable Rectifier With Several Experiment:

First Experiment :

  Under only a Resistor Load Circumstance, and ¦Ávaries from 0 to 180 degree.

Second Experiment:
  
  With a RL Load, the Output Voltage can be under zero which differs from the R Load one. And Also ¦Á varies from 30 to 150 degree.

Third Experiment:

  A RL Load with a Fly-Wheel Diode, the ¦Á is 60 degree. We can clearly see that the Diode forces the output voltage to be nearly zero while the Thyristor is off.
